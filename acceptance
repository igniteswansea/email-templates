We are delighted to confirm you have been selected to speak at our first event.
 
Please find attached a template you can use to put your 5 minutes presentation together. 
 
We would ask that you submit your presentation to us by [Date] for review, to enable us to begin to prepare the programme for the event.
 
The event will begin at [StartTime] and close at [CloseTime]. Doors open at [OpeningTime], and we ask that you arrive no later than [OpeningTime] so we can run through programme and setup.
 
We would be grateful if you could provide us with a short biography and photo of yourself at your earliest convenience, so we can include this in the programme which will be available on our website.
 
May we take the opportunity once again to thank you for your interest in speaking at Ignite XYZ. We very much look forward to your talk.
